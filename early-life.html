        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Peter Griffin was born in 1958 in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, to Francis and Thelma Griffin. He grew up in a rather dysfunctional household, with his father being an alcoholic and his mother being a strict, emotionally distant figure. His early years were marked by a series of unfortunate events and a lack of proper guidance, which contributed to Peterâ€™s immature and irresponsible nature. These experiences, along with his often naive perspective on life, shaped the eccentric man he would become. Much of his childhood remains a running joke in the show, with flashbacks that emphasize his clumsy, awkward, and sometimes clueless personality.<p>
